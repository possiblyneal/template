# Retrofit

Read [`lifecycle.md`](lifecycle.md) first — the manifest, ownership, check reporting, the remote gates, failure behavior, and the report shape are there and apply throughout.

A retrofit brings a repository that was never generated from this template under it: the destination has content and carries no record. Everything a generate builds from nothing, a retrofit has to reconcile against something somebody is already shipping.

The shared mechanics stay in [`generate.md`](generate.md) and are cited by heading rather than restated, so there is one source of truth for each. Follow a citation with `sed -n '/^### Step 3 /,/^### /p'` rather than opening the whole file.

## Steps

- **Step 1 — Resolve the source commit and preflight**
- **Step 2 — Build the candidate**
- **Step 3 — Overlay the payload's absent paths**
- **Step 4 — Provision the environment and the hooks**

The steps after these — reading the destination's units, reconciling its layout, writing the record and deciding the collisions, the hosted-write gate, and publishing — are not written yet. A run that reaches the end of step 4 stops there and reports the candidate it built, rather than improvising the rest against a real repository.

### Step 1 — Resolve the source commit and preflight

Resolve the requested source to an exact commit and run:

```bash
python3 apps/repo-builder/src/scripts/preflight.py retrofit \
  --template-repo <template-repo> \
  --target <ref-or-commit> \
  --subtree apps/github-repository-template/src/base-repo \
  --destination <path-to-destination-clone> \
  --destination-repository <owner/name> \
  --default-branch main
```

`--destination` is the operator's own clone and `--destination-repository` is what its origin must name; passing both is what settles a clone whose directory name and repository name differ. `--default-branch` is the payload's, and a destination on another name is reported rather than refused.

Every check reaches git and nothing else, so the report is about the destination as it sits on disk. Six conditions are hard stops: not a git repository, no origin remote, an origin disagreeing with the named repository, uncommitted edits to tracked files, a paused merge, rebase, cherry-pick or revert, and a record already present — that last one means the caller wanted [update](update.md) or [adopt](adopt.md). A rebase stopped at an `edit` step has a clean index, which is why the paused operation is its own check rather than something the clean-tree check would catch. Three are findings that never stop the run: untracked files, a default branch that is not the payload's, and every collision.

Retain the JSON. `payload_paths` is the delivery check's only deterministic ground truth and `collisions` is what step 3 writes against; recomputing either by hand later is how the two come to disagree.

A collision is evidence and not a decision. Preflight cannot classify one by ownership, because the ownership rules live in a record a retrofit writes at the end rather than reads at the start.

### Step 2 — Build the candidate

The candidate is a linked worktree of the operator's own destination clone, checked out into this repository's `tmp/`. Not [generate's payload-only tree](generate.md#step-3--materialize-the-candidate) and not an update's branch in place: the worktree carries the destination's history so the pull-request diff is real, shares its objects so a large history costs disk once, and leaves the operator's working directory untouched for the whole run.

Resolve the default branch from the API rather than from a local ref. Destinations exist with no `origin/HEAD` and with a default branch named `master`, and both read as `main` if the name is assumed:

```bash
default_branch=$(gh repo view <owner/name> --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name)
git -C <clone> fetch origin "$default_branch"
git -C <clone> worktree add -b retrofit/<first 12 of the payload commit> \
  <absolute path to this repository>/tmp/<repository-name> "origin/$default_branch"
```

The candidate path is absolute. `git -C` resolves a relative one against the clone, which would put the candidate inside the operator's working directory — the one thing this step promises to leave alone.

The fetch is explicit because the worktree branches from `origin/<default-branch>`, and a stale remote-tracking ref silently retrofits an older tree than the one the pull request will target.

The branch is named for the payload commit and the directory for the destination repository, using the identity preflight verified. Both names are addresses a resumed run has to find again, so neither is chosen freshly per session.

`tmp/` is resolved against this repository rather than against the directory the session was invoked from, and `tmp/*` in `.gitignore` is what keeps a candidate from being committed here by accident. The candidate is never torn down: it is the evidence the report cites. The report hands the operator the command that removes it, `git -C <clone> worktree remove <candidate path>`, rather than running it.

### Step 3 — Overlay the payload's absent paths

Write the payload paths preflight found absent, and write no colliding path at all. Every colliding path stays in the collision list for the per-file decision the flow reaches later. This satisfies the rule against deleting destination content to resolve a collision by construction; copy everything and restore afterwards is rejected, because it breaks that rule in the window between the two steps.

The absent set is `payload_paths` minus the `path` of every collision, taken from the preflight JSON rather than recomputed:

```bash
xargs -r -a <absent-paths> -d '\n' \
  git -C <template-repo> archive --format=tar "<commit>:<subtree>" -- |
  tar -x -i -C <candidate>
```

`-r` on `xargs` is what makes an empty absent set write nothing. Without it `xargs` still runs once, and `git archive <tree> --` with no pathspec after it archives the whole payload over every collision the flow has yet to decide. `git archive` is what carries the file mode across, so `scripts/check` lands executable. `-i` on tar is for the batching: a long path list makes `xargs` call `git archive` more than once, and without it tar stops at the first archive's end marker having silently extracted a prefix of the overlay. Count the extracted paths against the absent set before moving on, and read that count rather than the pipeline's exit status: an empty absent set leaves `tar` reading empty stdin, which exits non-zero on a run that correctly wrote nothing.

Untracked state in the operator's clone is deliberately left behind. A worktree is a fresh checkout, and step 4 rebuilds what the destination's tracked manifests describe. A tracked scratch directory comes along like any other tracked path.

### Step 4 — Provision the environment and the hooks

Provision the candidate's environment from its tracked manifests — the lockfiles and manifests the destination commits, resolved by the destination's own toolchain. An environment that cannot be rebuilt from tracked files is a finding to report against the destination, never something to copy across from the operator's clone: a check surface that passes only against an environment nobody can reproduce measures nothing.

Then install the hooks by the shared recipe at [Working hooks in a candidate](lifecycle.md#working-hooks-in-a-candidate), which names retrofit's scope, where the hooks directory sits, what an already-hooked clone owes before the key is pinned, and how the result is verified. Retrofit's candidate is the only one borrowing a hooks directory it does not own, so read that section's scope list rather than assuming another flow's.
